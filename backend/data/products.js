      'The HYDRA combines high fidelity Reverb and Tremolo to add space and dimension to your guitar, bass, or keyboard signal.

You can easily change the order of effects or the character of the Tremolo or Reverb with the HYDRA’s smart Alt Controls. You can even create an Infinite Hold Reverb Trail! Save up to three presets with ease using our intuitive save feature. Engage Reverb Trails on the fly, no more internal dip switches. The Hydra can be used with pro remote switching systems and offers both TRS Expression Pedal and External Tap Tempo inputs.
